Multibranch Pipelines: Automate branch discovery and treat dev, stage, qa, prep, prod as separate isolated workflows that map to distinct target environments.

Parameterized Builds: How to prompt users for values (CLIENT, DB_NAME, SQL_COMMAND) so the pipeline can be generic yet flexible.

Security Checks for SQL: Use regex in Groovy to block dangerous statements, explicitly wrap DML in BEGIN/COMMIT to enforce transaction boundaries, and add a “dry run” count check to avoid accidentally deleting too many rows.

Credential Management: Use withCredentials to securely provide DB username/password without leaking them in console output or code.

Logging & Auditing: Print enough information (branch, host, DB name, raw SQL, row counts, success/failure) so you can trace exactly what happened in each build.

Extensibility Considerations: Keep your Jenkinsfile modular so that, in the future, you can add:

Git-based SQL file inputs

Manual approval gates (e.g., for production)

External audit logging (e.g., sending JSON payloads to a central system)
